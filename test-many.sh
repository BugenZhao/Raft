#
# Script for running `go test` a bunch of times, in parallel, storing the test
# output as you go, and showing a nice status output telling you how you're
# doing.
#
# Normally, you should be able to execute this script with
#
#   ./go-test-many.sh
#
# and it should do The Right Thing(tm) by default. However, it does take some
# arguments so that you can tweak it for your testing setup. To understand
# them, we should first go quickly through what exactly this script does.
#
# First, it compiles your Go program (using go test -c) to ensure that all the
# tests are run on the same codebase, and to speed up the testing. Then, it
# runs the tester some number of times. It will run some number of testers in
# parallel, and when that number of running testers has been reached, it will
# wait for the oldest one it spawned to finish before spawning another. The
# output from each test i is stored in test-$i.log and test-$i.err (STDOUT and
# STDERR respectively).
#
# The options you can specify on the command line are:
#
#   1) how many times to run the tester (defaults to 100)
#   2) how many testers to run in parallel (defaults to the number of CPUs)
#   3) which subset of the tests to run (default to all tests)
#
# 3) is simply a regex that is passed to the tester under -test.run; any tests
# matching the regex will be run.
#
# The script is smart enough to clean up after itself if you kill it
# (in-progress tests are killed, their output is discarded, and no failure
# message is printed), and will automatically continue from where it left off
# if you kill it and then start it again.
#
# By now, you know everything that happens below.
# If you still want to read the code, go ahead.
